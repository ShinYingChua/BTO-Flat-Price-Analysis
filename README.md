## 2. Findings from EDA
- Construction material price dataset
    - Rebar is the most expensive material
    - Construction material price peaked in FY2007-2008
    - General decrease in price of construction material between FY2011-2015
    - General increase in price of construction material between FY2015-2018
- BTO flats price dataset
    -  General increase in selling price of BTO flats between FY2008-2021
    -  As the BTO flats size increases, the selling price increases
    -  Between FY2008-109, the selling price of BTO flats in Punggol is generaally the highest for all room types
## 3. Conclusion
Based on my findigns, the construction material price does not affect the BTO selling price significantly. The general increase in selling price of BTO flats could be attributed to the prevailing market conditions. Analyzing the additional resale flats dataset, it is observed that the resale price generally increased from FY2014-2021. This trend tallies with the BTO flats price dataset.
